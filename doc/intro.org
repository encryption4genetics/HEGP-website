* The $1,000 Challenge!

Crack the code! The authors announce the HEGP Challenge, with a $1,000
(one thousand dollar) prize and eternal fame for the person or group
who can crack HEGP encrypted data. HEGP, when proven solid, will have
a large impact on the way human genetics is pursued today because it
will allow for sharing genotype data while preserving privacy of the
individual. Sharing data is required for reproducible Science.

Here we discuss cracking HEGP, Rubik cube, DNA, strawberries and
Enigma.

* Explanation

Homomorphic encryption is a mathematical translation of data into an
encrypted form where the result of a computation is the same for the
unencrypted and encrypted forms. With HEGP a matrix of data is
tranformed by a high-dimensional random linear orthogonal
transformation key as described in the [[https://www.genetics.org/content/215/2/359][paper]] and visualised in below
animation (hit @@html: <span class="buttons"> <button
id="play">Play</button> </span>@@). The resulting matrix encrypts the
data while preserving the shape of the data.  @@html: <img width="80"

when a Rubik cube gets rotated the fields change color, but the object
still maintains its shape as a three dimensional cube!  With DNA the
genotype/phenotype shape is typically used to predict associations
between genotypes and phenotypes.  @@html: <img width="80"

preference for strawberry taste. An example of an associated genotype
is a DNA encoded [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_receptor][olfactory receptor]].

* Enigma

The Enigma machine is an encryption device developed and used in the
early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic and
military communication. It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany
during World War II, in all branches of the German military (source
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine][wikipedia]]).  @@html: <img src="enigma.jpg" align="left" />@@ Enigma
encrypted text by a tranformation and was cracked by the Polish Cipher
Bureau in 1932 and was used by the allied forces to win the war.  To
ascertain HEGP is bullet proof we invite the genius hackers and
algorithmically inclined to crack the code and make HEGP history (one
way or the other).
