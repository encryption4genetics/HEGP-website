* The $1,000 Challenge!

Crack the code! The authors announce the HEGP (heegeepee;
/hiːdʒiːpiː/) Challenge, with a $1,000 (one thousand dollar) prize for
the individual or group who can crack HEGP encrypted data. HEGP, when
proven solid, will have a large impact on the way human genetics is
pursued today because it will allow for sharing genotype data while
preserving privacy of the individual. Not only is sharing data
required for reproducible Science, there is also a large interest in
hosting data on laptops and servers that need not be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act][HIPAA]] compliant.

On this page we chat about cracking HEGP, Rubik cube, DNA,
strawberries and Enigma.

* Simple explanation

Homomorphic encryption is a mathematical translation of data into an
encrypted form where the result of a computation is the same for the
unencrypted and encrypted forms. With HEGP a matrix of data is
transformed by a high-dimensional random linear orthogonal
transformation key as described in the [[https://www.genetics.org/content/215/2/359][paper]] (open access) and
visualised in below animation (hit @@html: <span class="buttons">
<button id="playtxt">Play</button> </span>@@). The resulting matrix
scrambles the data while preserving the 'shape of the data' for
analysis.  @@html: <img width="80" src="rubik.jpg" align="right" />@@
One way to think about this is that when a Rubik cube gets rotated the
fields change colour, but the object still maintains its shape as a
three dimensional cube.  With DNA the genotype/phenotype shape is
typically used to predict associations between genotypes and
phenotypes.  @@html: <img width="80" src="strawberry.jpg"
align="right" />@@ An example of a phenotype is a preference for
strawberry taste. An example of an associated genotype is a DNA
encoded [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_receptor][olfactory receptor]].

Here we display a typical example of genome-wide association (GWA) of
phenotype against genotype:

association (GWA) of phenotype against genotype" />@@

Genes (on chromosomes) involved in some trait are marked. This is the
backbone computation for finding genes involved in some trait and
used, for example, in the [[https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/][UK Biobank]] involving half a million
subjects. They apply GWA to find genes involved in, for example,
cancer or COVID-19 mortality; the first steps towards finding better
treatments.

In above image data is shown before and after encryption. The
unencrypted data contains three values while the encrypted data shows
a normal distribution.

* Enigma

The Enigma machine is an encryption device developed and used in the
20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic and military
communication. It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during
World War II, in all branches of the German military (source
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine][wikipedia]]).  @@html: <img src="enigma.jpg" align="left" />@@ Enigma
encrypted text by a transformation and was cracked by the Polish
Cipher Bureau in 1932 and the crack was used by the allied forces to
win the war.  To ascertain HEGP is bullet proof, unlike ENIGMA, we
invite the algorithmic inclined to crack the code and make HEGP
history (one way or the other).
