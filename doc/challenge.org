* Animation

In above animation genotypes and phenotypes are encoded in a
matrix. Rows are individuals and columns are genotype markers along
chromosomes as well as phenotypes. Starting with the unencrypted data
it gets scrambled by the keywhile the analysis will still render the
same result (the black lines are values too small to show).

* Is this encryption safe?


We tried find ways of cracking the code as discussed in our [[https://www.genetics.org/content/215/2/359][paper]].
Brute force guessing of a solution would take more compute seconds
than there are molecules in the universe.

* What is the challenge?

The challenge consists of decryption of two data sets.

For the first challenge we encrypted a data set consisting of 500
individuals by 12,359 SNPs that exists somewhere in the
public domain. We consider this data cracked if you can identify 50
individuals correctly. Note that this data may be derived from human,
mouse, rat, nematode or plant data.

The second challenge is harder. We encrypted a mammalian data set that
is not in the public domain (yet). We consider the code cracked if you
compute the plaintext genotypes of this matrix correctly with mean
error of under 10%.

* Who wins a $1,000 check?

The best result with a publicly reproducible solution submitted by
December 31st 2020 wins the HEGP Challenge and a cash prize of one
thousand dollars. Points are given for improving the method. In case
of a tie the prize is shared. If there is no winner we will hold the
prize until someone claims it.

* How to submit?

Submit your answer through a public git repository with the exact steps take
to get there. The analysis should be reproducible by anyone. You can
announce your solution on the website [[https://github.com/encryption4genetics/HEGP-website/issues][issue tracker]].
