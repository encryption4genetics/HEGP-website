* Animation

In above animation genotypes and phenotypes are encoded in a
matrix. Rows are individuals and columns are genotype markers along
chromosomes as well as phenotypes. The data is scrambled while the
analysis will still renders the same result.

* Sharing genotype data!

With a [[https://www.genetics.org/content/215/2/359][publication in Genetics]] we present a novel Homomorphic
encryption method named HEGP that allows for sharing of genotypes and
phenotypes in the context of Genome Wide Association (GWA)
studies. Importantly sharing but without giving away *private*
information and making individuals identifiable.

With HEGP anyone can freely hand over genotype and phenotype data to
anyone else and have them reproduce the results. Even better, the
encoding can be stacked. So the second party can encrypt and combine
their data independently and give it to a third party.

So any party can use our data to add it their own analysis. And they
can share their data back with us. As such, genotype data can be
stored on (public) servers and GWA analysis can be reproduced.

This is a breakthrough in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data][FAIR data]] sharing and contrasts greatly with
current practices of hiding/protecting genotype data and only
providing summary statistics (which are not reproducible).

* Is this encryption safe?


We tried find ways of cracking the code as discussed in our [[https://www.genetics.org/content/215/2/359][paper]].
Brute force guessing of a solution would take more compute seconds
than there are molecules in the universe.

* What is the challenge?

The challenge consists of decryption of two data sets.

For the first challenge we encrypted a data set consisting of 10,000
genotypes by 200 individuals somewhere in the public domain. We
consider this data cracked if you can identify 5 individuals
correctly. Note that this data may be derived from human, mouse, rat,
nematode or plant data.

The second challenge is harder. We encrypted a mammal data set that is
not in the public domain (yet). We consider the code cracked if you
compute 30% of the genotypes of this matrix correctly (we specify the
margin of error).

* Who wins a

@@html: <img src="cheque.png" align="left" />@@ The best result with a
publicly reproducible solution submitted by December 31st 2020 wins
the HEGP Challenge and a cash prize of one thousand dollars. Points
are given for improving the method. In case of a tie the prize is
shared. If there is no winner we will hold the prize until someone
claims it.

* How to submit?

Submit your answer through a public git repository with the exact steps take
to get there. The analysis should be reproducible by anyone. You can
announce your solution on the website [[https://github.com/encryption4genetics/HEGP-website/issues][issue tracker]].
